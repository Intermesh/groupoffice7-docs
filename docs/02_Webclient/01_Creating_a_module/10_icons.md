GroupOffice uses [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) font.

You can lookup any icon there and use it's name prepended with "mdi-" in the 
class attribute of an elemnent:

````````````````````````````````````
<md-icon class="mdi-android"></md-icon>
````````````````````````````````````

md-icon will automaticall add the "mdi" class. If you're using the icon class on 
another element you will need to use:

````````````````````````````````````
<div class="mdi android"></div>
````````````````````````````````````
