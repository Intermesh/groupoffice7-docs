To deploy there's a special gulp build script.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
$ cd /var/www/html/groupoffice-webclient
$ gulp build
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This will build the client in the "build" folder. Upload this and your config.js
file to the server.
