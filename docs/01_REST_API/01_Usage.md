Group-Office has a [RESTFull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
API. It uses JSON as data format. To learn how the API works we're going to use the Postman REST Client. I assume you've already got the server up and running.

## Routes
You've installed the API somewhere. For example on http://example.com/api/index.php. 
When I refer to a route in this document, for example route "/auth" then this means:

http://example.com/api/index.php/auth

You can find a list of available routes here:

http://localhost/groupoffice-server/docs/apigen/class-GO.Core.Http.Router.html

## Authenticate

The authentication route is /auth so you can post this JSON object to create a
session:

```````````````````````````````````````````
{
	"username": "admin",
	"password": "Admin1!"
}
```````````````````````````````````````````

The server should respond with:

``````````````````
{
	"success": true
}
``````````````````

Use POSTMan to authenticate with a POST request.

## Listing users

In the routes list you will also find "/auth/users". Now that you're logged in as
admin you are able to list the users:

Use postman to do a GET request to route "/auth/users". It will return something like this:

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
{
	"success": true,
	"results": [{
		"id": 1,
		"deleted": false,
		"enabled": true,
		"username": "admin",
		"password": "",
		"digest": "",
		"createdAt": "2014-07-21T14:01:17Z",
		"modifiedAt": "2015-01-15T10:58:32Z",
		"loginCount": 84,
		"lastLogin": "2015-01-15T11:58:32Z",
		"isNew": false,
		"validationErrors": [ ],
		"className": "GO\\Modules\\Auth\\Model\\User",
		"passwordConfirm": null,
		"currentPassword": null,
		"markDeleted": false
		}]
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

A GET request that lists objects will return a "results" array with models in them.

All the routes link to their controller class where you can read more about the GET 
parameters they support.

In this case the controller class is:

http://localhost/groupoffice-server/docs/apigen/class-GO.Modules.Auth.Controller.UserController.html

You can read more about this [AbstractCrudController](http://localhost/groupoffice-server/docs/apigen/class-GO.Core.Controller.AbstractCrudController.html) in the API documenation.

## Data format
Each controller usually works with a model. The model should be mentioned in the
controller documentation. In this case it's the [User](http://localhost/groupoffice-server/docs/apigen/class-GO.Modules.Auth.Model.User.html) model. To see
which properties the user has look it up in the API documentation and take a look
at the magic properties.

You can view a single user by doing a GET request to the route /auth/users/1.
This will return the user:

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
{
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "deleted": false,
        "enabled": true,
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "",
        "digest": "",
        "createdAt": "2014-07-21T14:01:17Z",
        "modifiedAt": "2015-01-15T10:58:32Z",
        "loginCount": 84,
        "lastLogin": "2015-01-15T11:58:32Z",
        "isNew": false,
        "validationErrors": [],
        "className": "GO\\Modules\\Auth\\Model\\User",
        "passwordConfirm": null,
        "currentPassword": null,
        "markDeleted": false
    },
    "success": true
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When saving a user you must PUT or POST this user model in the same format. The 
server will respond with the success boolean. On failure the model will have one
or more "validationErrors".

In the PHP API the user is a Model based on [AbstractRecord](http://localhost/groupoffice-server/docs/apigen/class-GO.Core.Db.AbstractRecord.html).
