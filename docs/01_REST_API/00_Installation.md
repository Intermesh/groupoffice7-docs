Installation for development
============================

To install the GroupOffice server follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required software:
   ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   $ sudo apt-get install git curl
   ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

2. clone the repository:

   ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   $ git clone https://github.com/intermesh/groupoffice-server.git
   ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
3. Install composer if you haven't done that already. On Ubuntu do:

   ```````````````````````````````````````````````````
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
   ```````````````````````````````````````````````````
4. Run composer in the working directory:

   ``````````````````````````
   $ cd groupoffice-server
   $ composer install
   ``````````````````````````
5. Put the /html/index.php in a web server root and make sure the path to autoload.php
is correct:

   ```````````````````````````````````
   require("../vendor/autoload.php");
   ```````````````````````````````````
   Also adjust the path to config.php that you will create in step 7:
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   App::init(require('../config.php'));
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````
6. Create a MySQL database called "go7".
7. Copy config.php.example to config.php and adjust it with the correct database parameters.

	Now it should work. Launch index.php:

	/index.php

	This will redirect to a system test page:

	/index.php/modules/check

	Optionally you can create an alias for apache:

	Alias /api /path/to/index.php

	This allows pretty URL's like /api/system/check

	It should output that all is OK ;). It doesn't look pretty but it's not meant to
	be because it's just an API.

8. Click the link "Install / Upgrade database".

9. Now you can login

	The default login is:

	Username: admin
	Password: Admin1!
